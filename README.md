## React UI Basic Demo

Hello, everyone!

I have created a quick React UI demo. This app is a purchase list, that calculates total cost of your items. Your typical basic React demonstration. 


Super quick UI designs is one of React's main strength, it's all about UI designs. So this demo focuses on that - functions, counters, updates to DOM, props, states, etc. You can even add new items to the list. Other than Context API, this demo should have most of the bells and whistles of stock React library.

There are many reasons why React is popular. Lightweight and quick. Components. JSX. As of update 16.8 in February of 2019, React has become entirely NEW platform. Hooks and Context API have completely changed the framework. Classes are gone, constructors are gone with them, render method and lifecycle methods are gone, THIS keyword and binding, etc. Even Redux is basically gone with Hooks/Context API.

What is more amazing, is that nearly EVERYTHING written on and about React prior to February 2019 is now nearly useless. Classes used to be the foundation. The pace of innovation is truly stunning.

Take care!

Vic
